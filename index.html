            Every member of the human race knows that life can present difficult challenges, often taking all the fun out of our day to day lives.
            To overcome these obstacles there are a lot of good strategies you can employ, and very often the answer lies within. 
            One great way to dig deep and overcome your difficulties is to get motivated! You may need motivation for work, home life,
            or simply to gain the extra positive energy necessary to develop success and get through the week. 
            Enjoy the inspirational quotes below, and remember that the only limit to achieving our desires is one of imagination! 
            Create your own happy life by filling it with purpose, and you can achieve excellence and fulfill your own dreams and your own life plan on your terms.
            For some, there is only one motivation that they need, and that’s providing for their family. For others (like Elon Musk, for example) motivation can be harder to come by - 
            especially if your goal is to move the human race forward and onto Mars!. 
            feels like quitting at some point, and no one has all the answers. 
            And even though it can be tempting to get under the blanket and shut out the world sometimes, quitting won’t make the challenges go away. 
            If you give zero effort, you’ll have exactly the same number of chances at getting what you want.
            Use these motivational quotes for work, for your personal life, and for anything that requires that extra boost of motivation.
